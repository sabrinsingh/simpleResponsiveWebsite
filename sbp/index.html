                        <p>
                            Before we even consider the design aspects of your app, Ghrian Tech starts off with an in-depth consultation. We focus on three prime parameters that will frame your business model. These are:

                            Will this be a great app that actually solves user problems?
                            How will the app be marketed, and what execution needs to take place to build buzz for the app?
                            How will the app be monetized to provide revenue generation?
                            Parts of our mobile app development strategies involve determining how to market your app, how to build buzz before, during and after the launch, and what’s required to maintain success and visibility in an increasingly crowded marketplace.
